Welcome :)
I have created a github to show some of my personal projects to the world. I currently have 2 projects: Data Analysis and SQLLite3 Database Generation.

**1.) Data Analysis**

I cleaned and made various data visualizations with an Electric Vehicle Purchased Dataset
  
**2.) SQLLite3 Database Generation**


I created a SQLLite3 Database on my personal computer to hold lottery drawing numbers from 2010 to 2020.
